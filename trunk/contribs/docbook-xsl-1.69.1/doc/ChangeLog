	* Makefile: Refined doc build.
	
	  - Changed makefiles in docsrc/fo, docsrc/html, and
	    docsrc/manpages dirs to depend on corresponding params.xsl
	    instead of on param.xweb. Rationale is that param.xsl gets
	    rebuilt any time param.xweb changes. In addition, param.xsl
	    gets rebuild any time any included params/*.xml file is
	    changed. So making docsrc/* builds depend on param.xsl
	    effectively makes them depend on both the param.xweb changes
	    on on the actual param changes.
	
	  - Changed doc/Makefile so that reference.html is rebuilt only
	    when docsrc/reference.xml changes, not when any of its
	    included files change. Rationale is that, because we chunk
	    output for the doc build, reference.html is simply a sort of
	    TOC page that doesn't need to get remade if the included files
	    change. Because output of those included files goes to
	    separate fo, html, and manpages subdirs, and that output gets
	    generated by seperate make targets.

	* Makefile: Incorporated slides and website stylesheets into the build.
	
	Note: This currently only affects the "distrib" (doc) build. So if
	you don't need to build distrib/doc, you won't be affected by this
	change. If you DO need to build distrib/doc, it will break unless
	you use the xsl/Makefile from the "build" branch instead of from
	the head.
	
	This build alters the distrib build such that:
	
	  - an xsl/slides directory is created by copying over the
	    contents of the slides/xsl
	
	  - an xsl/website directory is created by copying over the
	    contents of the website/xsl directory
	
	  - the reference.html part of the doc build now adds the slides
	    and website param reference doc
	
	This is an experiment. If we decide to go ahead with it in the
	release build, and everything is found to be OK when it gets out
	to users and they test it, then the next step would be to ask SF
	admin to move the website/xsl and slides/xsl CVS directory into
	xsl/ to create xsl/slides and xsl/website, and they would be
	maintained in the xsl/ CVS going forward.

	* Makefile: Revert to Makefile from MAIN

2005-02-24  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile: changes needed for generating manpages ref doc, ported from build branch

	* Makefile: Added litprog reference documentation infrastructure for manpages.
	Note that changes to the existing Makefile doc/Makefile docsrc/Makefile files
	are on the build branch only, so will need to be back-ported to head
	in order for head builds of the docs to include doc for manpage params
