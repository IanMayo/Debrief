	<intro>
		<description>With ever-increasing data rates from multiple recording systems it is easy for an analysis plot to become swamped.  Debrief NG provides tools to reduce the volume and type of data displayed.  This tutorial will lead you through the management of large volumes of data.</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Check you have some data" href="/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window.  If is isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.  Also check you have our sample data-files - it they're not there, find how to load them from the "Loading sample data" cheat-sheet.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Open the sample sensor tracks">
		<description>Double-click on the "sen_tracks.rep" file, and you will see the red and blue vessel tracks.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Fit to window" href="\org.mwc.debrief.help\html\legacy\moving_around.html#Fit_To_Win">
		<description>To make sure all of the data is visible, click on the "Fit-to-Window" toolbar button.  To these tracks you're going to add the sensor data</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Drag in the SSK track">
		<description>From the Navigator window, drag the SSK sensor data file  (sen_ssk_sensor.rep) onto the plot.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="And now the FF track">
		<description>Next, drag the SSK sensor data file  (sen_frig_sensor.rep) onto the plot.  No, there hasn't been a visible change to the plot, but be assured, the data is there.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="View the sensor data">
		<description>From the Layer Manager, expand the 'tree' for each track (they're called 'Frigate' and 'New_SSK').  Within each track you will see named blocks of sensor data.  Make each block of sensor data visible by selecting it, then clicking on the 'make visible' toolbar button. As you make each set of data visible you should see its bearing fan appear. Overall there are three blocks of sensor data across the two tracks.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Formatting sensor data">
		<description>Sensor lines can be formatted to change their colour, their label, and the location of their label.  The formatting can be applied to a single sensor line or a series of sensor lines.  Now, the dense fans of sensor data present in the sample files you have don't lend themselves to being individually annotated. So we won't.  </description>
	</item>
	<item title="Format the sensor data">
		<description>What we're going to do now is simulate formatting a series of bearing lines to represent a particular sensor state.  So, from the Layer Manager open up the "NEW_SSK_BB" sensor for the "New_SSK" track.  Select the first five sensor bearings.  Now switch to the properties view.  This view should show the editable properties for those bearings.  Change the color from red to yellow.  You will see the sensor lines on the plot update.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Conduct a plot-lock">
		<description>What we're going to do now is to simulate the process of dragging tracks so that their bearing fans match.  In UK this is called a plot-lock, and in the US its called a tie-point.  From the workbench toolbar, click on the "Drag Whole Feature" button - it's a white arrow</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Done">
		<description>Well done, there you are.  Just repeat this process to add any other data directories you want to load data from.</description>
