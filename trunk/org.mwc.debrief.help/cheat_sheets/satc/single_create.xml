      <description>
         Ok, let&apos;s create our first scenario. <b>Note: &apos;Scenario&apos; is the term used to describe the collection of data that is collated in order for SATC to produce an optimal &apos;Solution&apos;.</b>

      <description>
         We&apos;re going to use all of the ownship sensor data to create our scenario.<br/>
         So, open the <b>Layer Manager</b>, then open the <b>Track:OWNSHIP</b>.  The ownship track has a <b>Sensors (1 items)</b> object.
         Open this and you will see the single block of sensor data.

      <description>
         Ok, we&apos;ve found the sensor data. Now right-click on this item (<b>Sensor:Plain (11 items)</b>), and
         select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / <b>Create new solution from these cuts</b>

      <description>
         You should see that there is now a new item in the <b>Layer Manager</b>. It has been given the name <b>121213.14</b>,
         that is the DTG of the first item in the bearing data. We will now change the name of the scenario.  Select it in the <b>Layer Manager</b>, 
         and you can now change its <b>Name</b> value to <b>Single Leg</b>in the <b>Properties</b> view.
         <br/>
         You will also see that the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view has opened - you will use this to create and manage your
         scenario data.  Please read the overview of the <b>Maintain Contributions </b> view using the Help Link provided below.

      <description>
         From the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view you will see that there is a single item listed in the <b>Analyst Contributions</b>.
         This is the bearing data that will be used to inform all of the subsequent contributions.  
         <br/>
         Let&apos;s learn more about it.  This contribution is the set of bearings that represent the unknown target track.  You will see that the contribution
         has an estimate value of <b>+/- 3 degs</b>. This means the algorithm will only offer solutions that are within 3 degrees of these bearing measurements.
         <br/>You can view these measurements.  First, select the <b>Single Leg</b> in the <b>Layer Manager</b>.  Then, in the <b>Properties Window</b>, tick the <b>ShowLocationConstraints</b> item.
         <br/>A set of "pie-slices" will now appear on the plot, showing the 3 degree allowable error on each bearing measurement.  If you expand the <b>Bearing Measurement - Bearing Data</b> contribution
         in the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view, you will see that it is possible to change the error value on this bearing data by moving the slider. As you move the slider you will see
         the pie slices expand and contract.
         <br/><br/>Note: the <b>Preferences</b> area of the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view includes the <b>Auto-Recalc of Constraints</b> two-state
         button.  This button is normally depressed. But, if you have a complex scenario that takes some time to update, you may wish to un-check this button.
         The screen will no longer be refreshed as you are interactively adjusting any contributions.

      <description>
         <br/>Note that in this sample data, we have a maximum range value for the bearings, of 12kyds.  
         In the absence of a range estimate they will be drawn out to 30 kyds.
         <br/>Also, before we continue, we need to reset Debrief to a predictable state, so please restore the <b>Bearing Measurement</b> analyst contribution to 3 degrees, and also clear the <b>ShowLocationConstraints</b> 
         checkbox for in the <b>Properties</b> View for the <b>Single Leg</b> scenario.

         title="Specify a target leg">
      <description>
         Your deep, deep, analysis skills have led you to believe that all of these cuts relate to a single leg of target data - in
         other words, the target maintains course and speed through the period of interest.  That information is useful to the 
         TMA algorithms.  Provide this information to the TMA algorithm by right-clicking once again on the <b>Sensor:Plain (11 items)</b> item
         in the <b>Layer Manager</b>, then browse down the menu to <b>Semi Auto TMA</b>, then <b>Add to Single Leg</b>. From the 
         menu that appears, select <b>Straight Leg for period covered by [sensor cuts]</b>. From the dialog that opens, name the contribution as <b>Leg limits</b>

         So, now there are two contributions: one which provides a set of bearings through which a solution must travel, and another which indicates that the target will
         have travelled on a single course and speed throughout the engagement.  The sharp-witted amongst you will have noticed that our two ownship turns have
         provided a valuable change in bearing rate - just the think a TMA algorithm wants.
