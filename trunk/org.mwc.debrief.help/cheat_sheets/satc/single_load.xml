         From the SATC sub-folder, drag the L1_OwnshipTrack.rep file into the Debrief plot area. (Or, right click it, and select "Open With > Debrief Plot Editor").

   <item title="Load ownship sensor data">
      <description>
         You should now see the Debrief editor, with a blue ownship track. Next, we will load the ownship sensor (sonar) data, by dragging in the "L1_OwnshipSensor.rep" file. Follow the Wizard steps to load the sensor data, give it a color, and indicate that Yes, you wish it to be visible.

   <item title="Check sensor data is visible">
      <description>
         You did follow the wizard steps correcly, didn't you?  If you haven't got a bearing fan displayed on the plot, use the Layer Manager View to navigate to the "Plain" sensor, and make it visible.
