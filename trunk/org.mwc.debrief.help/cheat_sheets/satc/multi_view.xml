         Let&apos;s understand the data we&apos;ve got, before we start playing with it

      title="View the ownship track">
      <description>         
         When you view the tutoral plot you will see an ownship track.  Use the Debrief Time Controller to 
         familiarise yourself with the general motion of the OWNSHIP track.  You&apos;ll see that it starts in the 
         North-East of the area, then travels quite slowly at 2.5 knots, with two straight legs.

      <description>         
         The identification of straight legs is pivotal to the SATC process, since they greatly constrain
         the possible solution combinations.
         <br/>
         Just as with manual TMA, the best practice for this process is to color the sensor cuts according
         to the leg they&apos;re contained in.  If you make the sensor data visible for the Ownship track, you&apos;ll see 
         that the first and second legs have been coloured in green and purple, respectively. Between each leg, a
         few cuts have been left red, to provide time for the target to make alterations.

         title="Mark the final target leg">
      <description>         
         Whilst the first two target legs have been coloured, the last one hasn&apos;t. So, expand the sensor data
         in the Layer Manager, and select the sensor cuts from <b>100112 124230</b> until the end of the
         dataset, at <b>100112 140000</b>.  Now use the <b>Properties</b> view to change the color of these cuts to <b>Yellow</b>.

      title="Create the scenario">
      <description>
         The most significant block of information in generating a solution is the bearing data.  So, the 
         first step is to specify bearing data.  We are going to use all of the Ownship sensor data for this
         solution, so right-click on the <b>Sensor:Plan (145 items)</b> sensor, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / 
         <b>Create new scenario from these cuts</b>.
         <br/>As with the previous tutorial, you will see the new scenario (called <b>121200.00</b> appear in the layer manager, and the 
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view will open. 
         <br/>You will also see that the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view contains just the one contribution.
      </description>

   <item
      title="Rename the scenario">
      <description>         
         To make it easier to navigate the data, please use the <b>Properties</b> view to rename 
         the new scenario to <b>Tutorial Scenario</b>
      </description>

   <item
      title="Try to generate a solution">
      <description>         
         Hey, why not try to generate a solution.  Just click on <b>Calculate Solution</b> at the top of the
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view.  You will see Debrief do a couple of seconds of processing, and then stop.
         This is because Debrief doesn&apos;t have enough information to generate a solution.  It needs to know
         one or more straight legs.         
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Mark first leg">
      <description>         
         Ok, let&apos;s mark the first leg. In the <b>Layer Manager</b>, expand the Ownship sensor data, and select all of the
         <b>Green</b> cuts.  Now, right-click on them, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / <b>Add to Tutorial Scenario</b> / 
         <b>Straight leg for period covered by [sensor cuts]</b>. When asked, give it the name <b>First Leg</b>.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Try to generate a solution (again)">
      <description>         
         Ok, now we should be able to generate a solution.  Again, click on <b>Calculate Solution</b> at the top of the
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view.  You will see Debrief do a couple of seconds of processing, you&apos;ll see
         a line graph appearing in the <b>Performance</b> area of the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view, and a green
         line will appear on the plot.  Zooming in on the plot shows us that the single leg is 9.2 kts, at 319 degrees.  If we 
         zoom out again, we can see that, Yes, this could be a solution that fits in the data.
         <br/><b>Note:</b> the use of randomisation in the SATC process means that your calculated speeds may well be different
         to mine. Don&apos;t worry, this is intended.

   <item
      title="Mark second leg">
      <description>         
         Now, we&apos;ll mark the second leg. In the <b>Layer Manager</b>, expand the Ownship sensor data, and select all of the
         <b>Purple</b> cuts.  Now, right-click on them, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / <b>Add to Tutorial Scenario</b> / 
         <b>Straight leg for period covered by [sensor cuts]</b>. When asked, give it the name <b>Second Leg</b>.
         <br/>The solution on the plot will disappear, since the new data means that it&apos;s probably incorrect.
         <br/>To see the effect of the new leg, click again on the <b>Calculate Solution</b> button.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Generate updated solution">
      <description>         
         Now generate a new solution.  You&apos;ll see two legs present, the first with 12.1 knots, and the second with 14.1 knots.
         Clearly SATC has changed it&apos;s optimal solution for the first leg to a faster one that is more compliant with the data 
         in the second leg.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Mark third leg">
      <description>         
         Ok, now let&apos;s mark the third leg using the <b>Yellow</b> cuts, and re-generate the solution again.  The solution
         produced has a speed of 4.8 knots.
         <br/>So, now we have a three-leg solution that is compliant with our sensor data, and our straight leg forecasts.
         <br/>We can take a step to verify this by switching on the location constraints.  First, select the <b>Tutorial Scenario</b>
          in the <b>Layer Manager</b>. Then, in the <b>Properties</b> window, switch on <b>ShowLocationConstraints</b>. You&apos;ll see
         lots and lots of clutter on the plot. Also switch on <b>OnlyShowLegEnds</b>.  This shows the calculated location 
         constraints at the start and end of each leg.  We can see that yes, the solution is compliant with them.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Give speed constraint">
      <description>         
         So, we&apos;ve got a solution.  But, I think it can be improved.  Let&apos;s try to give the target a consistent speed. We&apos;re
         going to give a speed constraint to the whole period of the engagement. We could have done this by right-clicking on the whole <b>Sensor:Plain</b>
         object, but an alternate way of doing this is to right-click on our <b>Tutorial Scenario</b> object in the <b>Layer Manager</b>,  
         and selecting <b>Add speed constraint for the period covered by [Tutorial Scenario</b>.  A wizard will open, name the contribution
         as <b>Overall Speed</b>. You will see this new constraint displayed in the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view - with a default set
         of hard constraints shown: zero to forty knots.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Adjust speed constraint">
      <description>
         Ok, let&apos;s generate a new solution.  A constraint of 0-40 knots isn&apos;t much of a constraint at all, so it has little effect.  So,
         expand the <b>Speed Constraint - overall speed</b> item in the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view. Now reduce the maximum speed from 
         40 knots down to 15 knots.  If you still have the Location constraints visible, you will see them adjust to repesent the new constraint.
         <br/>This is because the vessel can&apos;t travel as far in each leg.  Also, increase the minimum speed to 8 knots.  Re-generate the solution
         and see what you think.  
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Provide speed estimate">
      <description>
         Lastly, let&apos;s try and estimate.  The estimate will make the algorithm favour solutions near that value, though
         it will still consider solutions that are still within the min/max hard constraints.  Try an estimate of 9 knots, and re-generate
         the solution.  I get a solution with speeds of 9, 13, and 9 knots.  But, I can see that if the overall solution was moved nearer to ownship,
         I may be able to achieve a consistent speed. So, now reduce the max speed to 10 knots, and re-generate the solution.  
         <br/>This gives me legs that are 9.6, 8.9 and 9.0 knots.  I may then choose to drag in the min/max sliders to really force
         the solution onto a particular speed, but I&apos;m ok with this answer.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Verify solution">
      <description>
         Ok, now how good is that solution?  In the <b>Layer Manager</b>, make the <b>SUBJECT</b> track visible.  You should see
         that the generated solution is very close to the truth track, even with this low bearing rate data.
